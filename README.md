## Quick Start

Here's a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you're familiar with the
GitHub workflow and you're happy to use the automated preview of your doc
updates:

1. Fork the [Kmesh/website repo](https://github.com/kmesh-net/website) on GitHub.
2. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR).
3. If you're not yet ready for a review, add a comment to the PR saying it's a
   work in progress or add `[WIP]` in your PRs title. You can also add `/hold` in a comment to mark the PR as not
   ready for merge.
4. Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it's ready,
   you should see a comment like this: **Deploy Preview for kmesh-net ready!**
5. Click **Details** to the right of "Deploy preview ready" to see a preview
   of your updates.
6. Continue updating your doc until you're happy with it.
7. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR and assign a
   reviewer/approver. See the
   [Kmesh contributor guide](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
