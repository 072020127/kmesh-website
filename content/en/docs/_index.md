Kmesh is a service mesh data plane software implemented based on the programmable kernel. By sinking service governance to the operating system, Kmesh implements multiple hops of service access paths in the mesh, greatly improving service forwarding performance in the mesh.

In the following docs, we will explain:

- The [architecture](./architecture/_index.md) and highlights advantages of Kmesh.
- The [quick start](./welcome/quickstart.md) of Kmesh.
- The [performance](./performance/_index.md) of Kmesh.
- The [community](./community/contribute.md) of Kmesh.
